# Team BLDR

When you go to a hackathon, there's three ways you can get involved with a project:
  - Come with a pre-made team
  - Come without a team and try to find teams that need your expertise
  - Come without a team but with a project idea

Additionally, most hackathons provide alloted times for teams to be built, and for people to interact with each other. However, this assumes that every single attendee will utilize the pre-defined channels of communication for getting team members (i.e. slack). There is also the problem of volume: The more hackers that come to hackathons, the smaller the chances are that an individual hacker will interact with the right type of person and find a suitable team.

# Our Solution

What if we provided an interface where incoming hackers can post their skills, and project ideas with technologies they think will be necessary, and then just match people to projects? Team BLDR does that. It lets members sign up for the service, create a developer profile wherein they specify their strengths (programming languages, API experience, etc...) and what type of project they're interested in working on (web development, app development, AI, hardware, etc..). It also lets developers create project posts, which specify what their project is about, and what skills they're looking for in developers for that project. Afterwards, existing users can get matched up to projects which are most relevant to them.

This would benefit developers because it takes away the hassle of trying to find a project. It helps teams which do not have enough members to accomplish a task. Lastly, this helps event organizers accurately gauge how many projects are on-going, and provides a data pool that can be analyzed for statistical purposes (i.e. how many projects were hardware-related? App development related?).
